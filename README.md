# ðŸš˜ Driver Drowsiness Detection System  

This project is a *real-time driver drowsiness detection system* that uses computer vision techniques to monitor a driver's eyes and trigger an alarm if signs of drowsiness are detected. It helps prevent road accidents caused by fatigue or sleepiness.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Real-time *eye and face detection* using OpenCV & dlib.  
- Detects *blinking rate and eye closure* to measure drowsiness.  
- Plays an *alarm sound* when drowsiness is detected.  
- Easy-to-use and lightweight implementation.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used  
- *Python*  
- *OpenCV* (for image/video processing)  
- *dlib* (for face landmarks detection)  
- *imutils* (helper functions for image processing)  
- *playsound / pygame* (for alarm sound)
